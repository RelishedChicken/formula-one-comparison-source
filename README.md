# A simple F1 analysis app

I've created this as a way to break down the data from the Ergast Motorsports API (http://ergast.com/mrd/). This lets you see results since 1950 and aims to display these in a easy to consume way. I also intend to show an analysis of driver and constructors points per round and other metrics.

## Can I see the live version?

Yes, it's stored in another repository however due to how the build system in Vue works. You can see it here: https://github.com/RelishedChicken/formula-one-comparison. It's on GitHub pages too, here: https://relishedchicken.github.io/formula-one-comparison/

## Acknowledgements
Ergast API for thier brilliant API! - http://ergast.com/mrd/
I have also used some of F1's fonts. I'm happy to remove these however this is not monetised in any way, just a personal project.
